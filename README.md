### Overview
Data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) show an increasing prevalence of fatal injuries and deaths due to violent behaviors, including suicide, homicide, and firearm-related incidents. The objectives of this study are: i) to describe the prevalence of past-year history of suicidal ideation (SI) or violent behaviors (VB) among U.S. adults; ii) to identify factors (e.g., demographic factors, mental health disorders, substance abuse, etc) associated with SI and/or VB; and iii) to investigate trends in the utilization of mental health services among U.S. adults with SI or VB. The dataset that will be used is the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2015 to 2022. The target population is U.S. adults aged 18–64 with past-year history of suicidal ideation or violent behaviors.
