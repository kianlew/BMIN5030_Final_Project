### Overview
Data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) show an increasing prevalence of fatal injuries and deaths due to violent behaviors, including suicide, homicide, and firearm-related incidents. The objectives of this study are: i) to describe the prevalence of past-year history of suicidal ideation (SI) or violent behaviors (VB) among U.S. adults; ii) to identify factors (e.g., demographic factors, mental health disorders, substance abuse, etc) associated with SI and/or VB; and iii) to investigate trends in the utilization of mental health services among U.S. adults with SI and/or VB. iv) to investigate trends of the unmet need for mental health services among U.S. adults with SI and/or VB. v) to describe the reasons behind the unmet need for mental health services among U.S. adults with SI and/or VB. The dataset that will be used is the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2015 to 2021. The target population is U.S. adults aged 18–64 with past-year history of suicidal ideation or violent behaviors.
